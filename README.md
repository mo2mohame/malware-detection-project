# Malware Detection Project

## Project Description
This project focuses on detecting malware using a combination of machine learning and deep learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Recursive Neural Networks (RNN).

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is `apiCallsSequences.csv`, containing API call sequences from various software samples.
- Some features were removed for preprocessing purposes to improve the model's performance.

## Models Used
- **SVM**: Support Vector Machine with linear kernel.
- **Naive Bayes**: A Gaussian Naive Bayes model.
- **LSTM**: A Long Short-Term Memory model for sequential data.
- **RNN**: A Recursive Neural Network model for comparison with LSTM.

## Project Structure
- `code`: Contains the main code file, including the implementation of machine learning models and deep learning models.
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `docs/`: Includes the presentation explaining the project.
